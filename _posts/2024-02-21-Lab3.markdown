# Lab3

## Prelab

### 1. Note the I2C sensor address

<img src="../images/Lab3/i2c addr of ToF sensor.png" alt="i2c addr of ToF sensor" style="zoom:50%;" />

The I2C sensor address if 0x29

### 2. **Briefly** discuss the approach to using 2 ToF sensors



### 3. **Briefly** discuss placement of sensors on robot and scenarios where you will miss obstacles



### 4. Sketch of wiring diagram



## Lab Tasks

### 1. Picture of your ToF sensor connected to your QWIIC breakout board



### 2. Screenshot of Artemis scanning for I2C device (and discussion on I2C address)



### 3. Discussion and pictures of sensor data with chosen mode



### 4. 2 ToF sensors: Discussion and screenshot of sensors working in parallel



### 5. Tof sensor speed: Discussion on speed and limiting factor; include code snippet of how you do this



### 6. Time v Distance: Include graph of data sent over bluetooth (2 sensors)



### 7. (5000) Discussion on infrared transmission based sensors



### 8. (5000) Sensitivity of sensors to colors and textures
